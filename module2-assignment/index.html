                <p class="content">
                    Jessie is the short-tempered member of the Team Rocket trio, having a tough streak as well as being vain and very prone to anger. Every time she has stolen someone else's belongings or Pokémon, she always claims, "Your things are mine, my things are still mine." Due to her pride, she usually underestimates her opponents' strength, which is a cause for her own failure. She tends to be a drama queen and has a diabolical temperament.
                    She has long red hair that she wears curled in a comet-tail behind her head (various Pokémon keep cutting her hair).

                <p class="content">
                    James is initially seen as a calm and serious person who tends to recite the team rocket motto with more elegance and flair than his cohorts. As the series continued, however, much of the trio's original seriousness melted away. 
                    Despite his reputation as a "bad guy", he temporarily sides with Ash and his friends on various occassions, and calls on their help as well.
                    James has shoulder-length periwinkle hair with a single fringe sprouting from the center.
                    He is shown to be the most emotional of the Team Rocket and has the greatest moral conscience among the three.

                <h3 class="topic" id= "meowth">Meowth</h3>
                <p class="content">
                    Meowth fits in perfectly with his human comrades of Team Rocket as he is conniving, prideful, greedy, and mischievous.
                    His ability to speak like a normal human only makes him equally outspoken. He sometimes views himself as the boss and the leader of the trio, reason being, that he builds all the contraptions and thinks of all the plans, though he is rarely taken seriously (and like James, Meowth can be rather submissive to the domineering Jessie).
                    He is loyal to Jessie and James, and never lets a few fights get in his way of being friends with them.
